# S.A.M-Mutation-Core

S.A.M-Mutation-Core is a module within the S.A.M (Software Analysis and Mutation) system, designed to manage the mutation process and optimize it for software testing. Main module S.A.M-Mutation-Core stands as a pivotal component within the S.A.M (Software Analysis and Mutation) system, an innovative framework tailored to elevate software testing processes. This module is meticulously crafted to orchestrate mutation processes and augment their efficiency for rigorous software scrutiny.

## Key Objectives

The primary objectives of S.A.M-Mutation-Core encompass:

- **Streamlined Integration**: Establishing seamless integration with popular development environments and build systems for effortless adoption and utilization.
  
- **Comprehensive Configuration Management**: Offering an extensive suite of configuration files to fine-tune and manage mutation processes, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to diverse testing scenarios.

- **Enhanced Mutation Testing Capabilities**: Empowering users with the ability to conduct mutation testing across multiple files while providing comprehensive reporting functionalities to facilitate informed decision-making.

- **Statistical Optimization with Bayesian Inference**: Leveraging advanced statistical techniques, including Bayesian inference, to optimize mutation testing configurations and enhance testing efficiency.

- **Seamless Compatibility with PiTest**: Ensuring compatibility with PiTest, a renowned mutation testing framework, to leverage its capabilities seamlessly and amplify the effectiveness of mutation testing processes.


## Features

- Integration with IntelliJ development environment and Maven builder.
- Configuration files for mutation process management and optimization.
- Support for mutation testing on multiple files with detailed reporting.
- Bayesian statistical inference-based optimization configuration.
- Compatibility with PiTest system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelmnich/S.A.M-Mutation-Core.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd S.A.M-Mutation-Core
```

3. Build the project using Maven:
